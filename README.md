Developed an end-to-end NLP pipeline to analyze Twitter sentiment on climate change. The project focused on classifying public opinions into belief categories (e.g., pro-climate, denial, neutral) using natural language processing and supervised machine learning.

1-Preprocessed raw tweets using regex cleaning, hashtag extraction, and lemmatization with POS tagging.

2-Performed exploratory data analysis on tweet lengths, hashtags, and key named entities.

3-Built and evaluated multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Linear SVM.

4-Used TF-IDF vectorization and pipelines for feature extraction and training.

5-Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

6-Tuned hyperparameters and selected the best-performing model for final submission in a Kaggle-style challenge.
