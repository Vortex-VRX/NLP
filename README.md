Description: Developed an Arabic text classification pipeline focused on sentiment analysis and user feedback categorization. The project utilized pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT variants via HuggingFace) and included the following components:

•	Preprocessing & Cleaning: Implemented advanced Arabic text preprocessing, including emoji removal, stemming, diacritic stripping, normalization, and noise reduction using pyarabic and regex techniques.

•	Model Training: Fine-tuned transformer-based models (e.g., AutoModelForSequenceClassification) on labeled Arabic datasets using PyTorch and HuggingFace’s Trainer API with Optuna for hyperparameter tuning.

•	Evaluation & Metrics: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, and visualized confusion matrices.

•	Optimization: Enabled GPU acceleration and managed computational resources efficiently for large-scale training.
